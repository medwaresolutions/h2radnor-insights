# Female CEO representation and survey for women leaders in Australia’s pharmaceutical industry (Feb 28 2026)

## Overview

This study examines how many of Australia’s largest companies are led by women.  The analysis focuses on the **top‑20 firms (by market capitalisation)** in five sectors: **pharmaceutical/biotechnology**, **banking/finance**, **construction/engineering**, **retail**, and **mining/materials**.  For each industry, I identified the chief executive of each company using company websites, annual reports and reliable news articles.  Where a woman was CEO, the evidence is cited.  The overall picture is contrasted against the experiences of women leaders in the pharmaceutical sector, for whom a targeted survey is proposed.

## Methodology

1. **Selecting companies** – The top‑20 lists were drawn primarily from Simply Wall St market‑capitalisation rankings (Feb 27 2026).  Where fewer than 20 firms existed (e.g., banking), companies were supplemented by other large financial institutions to reach 20.
2. **Identifying CEOs** – Each company’s current chief executive officer (CEO) or managing director was confirmed using official company sites or credible news sources.  Male CEOs were noted but not individually cited; female CEOs were documented with citations.
3. **Calculating representation** – The number of female CEOs was divided by 20 to obtain the percentage of female‑led firms in each industry.

## Female CEOs in the pharmaceutical/biotech industry

The Australian pharma/biotech sector remains male‑dominated.  Among the 20 largest ASX‑listed pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies by market cap, only **three** were headed by women in February 2026.  These women and their companies are:

| Company | Evidence of female CEO | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Clarity Pharmaceuticals** | The senior executive page lists **Michelle Parker** as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director; she joined the company in 2018 and joined the board in 2024. | Mid‑cap radiopharmaceutical company.
| **Dimerix** | The board page notes **Nina Webster** serves as “Chief Executive Officer / Managing Director” and highlights her 30‑year pharmaceutical career. | Clinical‑stage biotech focused on inflammatory diseases.
| **Starpharma** | The leadership page states that **Cheryl Maley** was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director on 8 Jan 2024. | Specialist drug‑delivery company (VivaGel® and DEP® platforms).

No other company in the top‑20 list had a female CEO.  For example, **Telix Pharmaceuticals** is headed by Dr Christian Behrenbruch, **CSL** appointed Gordon Naylor as interim CEO in February 2026, **Mesoblast** is led by Silviu Itescu, **Neuren Pharmaceuticals** by Jon Pilcher, **PYC Therapeutics** by Dr Rohan Hockings and **Actinogen Medical** by Dr Steven Gourlay.  Similarly, Race Oncology, Orthocell, Aroa Biosurgery, Mayne Pharma, Tetratherix, Nyrada, Recce Pharmaceuticals and Vita Life Sciences are all run by men.  Outside the top 20, **Noxopharm** does have a female CEO; Dr Gisela Mautner was appointed CEO in 2022.

**Representation:** 3 of 20 pharma/biotech companies (~15 %) have female CEOs.

## Global pharmaceutical subsidiaries (Novartis, AbbVie and Pfizer)

The rankings above focus on locally listed companies.  However, several **multinational pharmaceutical firms** operate large subsidiaries in Australia, and their local leadership also influences perceptions of gender equality.  Three prominent examples are **Novartis**, **AbbVie** and **Pfizer**.  Evidence from independent sources and company filings shows that each of these subsidiaries is led by a woman in 2025–2026:

| Company | Evidence of female local leader | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Novartis Australia & New Zealand** | A Dec 17 2025 article from *Pharma in Focus* reported that Novartis appointed **Allison Rossiter** as its new **Country President** for Australia and New Zealand; Rossiter, who previously served as CEO of Genetic Signatures and Managing Director of Roche Diagnostics, will start in March 2026.  An ASX announcement from Genetic Signatures subsequently confirmed that **Ms Allison Rossiter** would leave the company in late Feb 2026 “to take on a role with a global pharmaceutical company”—implicitly referring to her move to Novartis. | Rossiter’s appointment means Novartis’ Australian affiliate will be headed by a woman from March 2026.
| **AbbVie Australia & New Zealand** | The Medicines Australia 2025 AGM announcement noted that **Nathalie McNeil**, Vice President and **General Manager ANZ** at AbbVie, had served on the industry body’s board for a full three‑year term.  An academic article on leveraging medical affairs lists **Nathalie McNeil** as **Vice President and General Manager for AbbVie (Australia & New Zealand)**. | McNeil has led AbbVie’s ANZ operations since 2022 and sits on industry bodies, making her one of the highest‑profile women leaders in pharma.
| **Pfizer Australia & New Zealand** | Pfizer’s 6 Aug 2024 media release about upgrading its Melbourne manufacturing plant quoted **Anne Harris**, **Managing Director of Pfizer Australia & New Zealand**, discussing the investment and emphasising the company’s commitment to antimicrobial resistance.  The Medicines Australia board‑members page also lists **Anne Harris** as **Managing Director, Pfizer Australia and New Zealand**. | Harris has led Pfizer’s ANZ business since 2020 and sits as Deputy Chair of Medicines Australia.

Including these subsidiaries increases the count of women leading significant pharmaceutical businesses in Australia.  While they are not part of the top‑20 ASX‑listed companies, they employ thousands of people and shape industry culture.  Factoring them in brings the total number of pharma/biotech entities with female leadership to **six** (three ASX‑listed companies plus Novartis, AbbVie and Pfizer).  This broader perspective suggests that **female leadership is stronger among multinational subsidiaries than within locally listed firms**, which may signal that global corporate policies or leadership pipelines are more effective at promoting women to top roles.

## Female CEOs in the banking/finance sector

Financial services remains more diverse than pharma but still heavily male‑led.  Among the top‑20 banks and large financial institutions in Australia, **four** had female chief executives:

| Company | Evidence of female CEO | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Macquarie Group** | The executive committee page states that **Shemara Wikramanayake** has been Managing Director and CEO since 2018. | Only major bank with a long‑tenured female CEO.
| **ING Bank (Australia)** | The Champions of Change Coalition notes that **Melanie Evans** was appointed CEO of ING Australia in November 2020. | 
| **Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)** | ASX’s executive‑leadership page notes that **Helen Lofthouse** commenced as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer in August 2022. | Although not a bank, ASX is a major financial‑market operator.
| **Magellan Financial Group** | The “Meet the Team” page shows **Sophia Rahmani** was appointed CEO and Managing Director in March 2025. | Asset‑management company.

No major “big four” bank (Commonwealth, National Australia Bank, Westpac or ANZ) was headed by a woman in February 2026.  Bendigo & Adelaide Bank and Bank of Queensland also had male CEOs.  **Representation:** 4 of 20 banking/finance firms (~20 %) had female CEOs.

## Female CEOs in construction/engineering

Large construction and engineering companies have extremely low female representation.  A notable exception is **Aurecon**, a global engineering consultancy.  In February 2025, Aurecon announced that **Louise Adams**—formerly its chief operating officer—would become group CEO from 1 July 2025.  An article by Consultancy.com.au highlighted that she would succeed William Cox and would be Aurecon’s first female group CEO.  Most major construction contractors (Lendlease, CIMIC Group, Downer EDI, Boral, Mirvac, Fulton Hogan, John Holland, etc.) continue to be led by men.

**Representation:** 1 of 20 leading construction/engineering firms (~5 %) had a female CEO.

## Female CEOs in the retail sector

Retail has comparatively strong female representation.  Among the 20 largest ASX‑listed retailers, **five** companies were headed by women:

| Company | Evidence of female CEO | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Woolworths Group** | Woolworths Group’s executive bio shows **Amanda Bardwell** was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director on 21 Feb 2024 (effective 1 Sept 2024). | Bardwell is the first woman to lead Australia’s largest supermarket chain.
| **Coles Group** | Coles’ leadership page states that **Leah Weckert** became CEO and Managing Director of Coles Group on 1 May 2023. | She is the first female CEO in Coles’ 100‑year history.
| **Harvey Norman** | At a 2025 AGM, Harvey Norman identified **Katie Page** as its Chief Executive Officer; she spoke about the company’s global expansion strategy. | Page has led the retailer since 1999.
| **Adairs** | The investor‑centre page lists **Elle Roseby** as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. | Homewares retailer; she took the role in January 2025.
| **Universal Store Holdings** | Universal Store’s investor centre lists **Alice Barbery** as Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director. | Fashion‑retail chain.

Other top retailers—including JB Hi‑Fi, Wesfarmers, Premier Investments, Super Retail Group, Lovisa, Nick Scali, Temple & Webster, Accent Group and Kogan—were led by men.  **Representation:** 5 of 20 retail companies (~25 %) have female CEOs, making retail the most gender‑diverse industry among those analysed.

## Female CEOs in mining/materials

The mining and materials sector remains overwhelmingly male‑led.  Out of the 20 largest ASX‑listed materials companies (mining, metals and chemicals), only **one** had a female chief executive:

| Company | Evidence of female CEO | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Lynas Rare Earths** | A news report described **Amanda Lacaze** as “easily the most prominent female CEO of a publicly‑listed Australian mining company” and noted she announced her retirement after 12 years leading Lynas. | She remains in the role until the end of FY2026.  All other major miners (BHP, Fortescue, Northern Star, Evolution, South32, Pilbara Minerals, Mineral Resources, Orica, etc.) are led by men.

**Representation:** 1 of 20 materials companies (~5 %) have female CEOs.

## Summary of female CEO representation

The chart below summarises the number of female CEOs and the percentage of women‑led companies within each industry.

| Industry (Top‑20 companies) | Female CEOs | Percentage of top‑20 | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pharma/Biotech** | 3 | 15 % | Clarity Pharmaceuticals – Michelle Parker; Dimerix – Nina Webster; Starpharma – Cheryl Maley. |
| **Banking/Finance** | 4 | 20 % | Macquarie Group – Shemara Wikramanayake; ING Bank – Melanie Evans; ASX – Helen Lofthouse; Magellan Financial Group – Sophia Rahmani. |
| **Construction/Engineering** | 1 | 5 % | Aurecon – Louise Adams (first female group CEO, effective 1 Jul 2025). |
| **Retail** | 5 | 25 % | Woolworths Group – Amanda Bardwell; Coles Group – Leah Weckert; Harvey Norman – Katie Page; Adairs – Elle Roseby; Universal Store Holdings – Alice Barbery. |
| **Mining/Materials** | 1 | 5 % | Lynas Rare Earths – Amanda Lacaze. |

These figures highlight stark disparities: while retail and finance have made some progress, pharmaceuticals (15 %) and especially construction and mining (both ~5 %) lag far behind.

## Proposed survey for women in senior pharmaceutical roles

The following survey is designed for up to **ten women** in senior positions within the Australian pharmaceutical industry.  Its purpose is to assess perceptions of equality (pay, promotions, representation) and attitudes toward minority groups, and to compare experiences in pharma with other industries.  Each question can be answered on a Likert scale (e.g., 1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree) with space for comments.

1. **Pay and remuneration**
   - *Salary parity*: “Compared with men in similar roles at your organisation, I believe my compensation is equitable.”
   - *Transparency*: “My employer is transparent about pay bands and criteria for salary reviews.”
2. **Promotion and career progression**
   - *Fair advancement*: “Promotions in my organisation are based on merit rather than gender or personal connections.”
   - *Opportunities*: “I am given the same opportunities for advancement (stretch assignments, visibility with senior leaders) as my male colleagues.”
   - *Perceptions*: “When I have been promoted or recognised, my colleagues perceive it as deserved rather than due to diversity initiatives.”
3. **Representation and leadership culture**
   - *Female representation*: “There are sufficient women in senior leadership roles in my organisation to provide mentorship and role models.”
   - *Organisational culture*: “The culture in my organisation is inclusive and supports diverse leadership styles.”
4. **Experiences of minority groups**
   - *Religious, gender and LGBTQ+ inclusion*: “People from minority religious backgrounds, different gender identities or sexual orientations are treated with respect and fairness in my organisation.”
   - *Reporting mechanisms*: “Employees feel safe raising concerns about discrimination or harassment related to gender, religion or sexuality.”
   - *Practical support*: “My organisation actively supports flexible working arrangements, parental leave and cultural/religious accommodations.”
5. **Comparison with other industries**
   - “From what I know of banking/finance, construction, retail or other industries, the pharmaceutical industry offers **better / similar / worse** opportunities for women in leadership.” (Please elaborate.)
   - “Are there practices from other industries that you believe pharma should adopt to improve gender and minority inclusion?” (Open‑ended.)
6. **Overall satisfaction and recommendations**
   - “Overall, I am satisfied with my career progression and inclusion experiences in the pharmaceutical industry.”
   - “What one change would most improve equality and inclusion in your organisation?” (Open‑ended.)

## Interpretation and implications

Despite some high‑profile female leaders, women remain under‑represented at the helm of Australia’s largest companies.  **Retail** stands out as the most gender‑balanced sector (25 % of top‑20 companies led by women), while **construction** and **mining** remain male‑dominated (5 %).  The **pharmaceutical/biotech** industry sits in the middle (15 %), but it still lags behind finance and retail.  These figures suggest that women in pharma may encounter structural barriers similar to those in other STEM‑related fields.  The survey aims to capture whether these statistics translate into lived experience—whether pay, promotions and representation feel equitable and how organisations treat religious, gender and LGBTQ+ minorities.

After collecting survey responses, comparing them with the cross‑industry statistics above can identify whether the pharmaceutical industry truly offers a more equitable environment or whether improvements seen in sectors like retail could be emulated.
