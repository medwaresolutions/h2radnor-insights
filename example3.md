## Key Takeaways

- **Sales declined across the board** — Net sales came in at $10.46 billion, down 4.0% reported and 2.8% organically, driven by volume declines and negative price/mix. The weakness was primarily caused by soft US Spirits performance and continued pressure in Chinese white spirits (CWS). Excluding CWS, group organic net sales would have been roughly 2% higher.

- **Mixed regional performance with clear bright spots** — Strong performance in Europe, Latin America & Caribbean, and Africa was offset by weakening in North America and continued weakness in Chinese white spirits in Asia Pacific. Guinness was a standout, delivering organic net sales growth of 10.9% with growth in all regions apart from APAC. Scotch also returned to growth across the Johnnie Walker range (Red, Black, and Blue all up).

- **Major asset sale to strengthen the balance sheet** — Diageo announced an agreement to sell its shareholding in East African Breweries plc (EABL) and its Kenyan spirits business to Asahi Group Holdings for estimated net proceeds of $2.3 billion (implying a 17x EBITDA multiple). The deal is expected to complete in H2 calendar year 2026 and reduce net debt to adjusted EBITDA by approximately 0.25x.

- **Dividend slashed significantly with new payout policy** — The interim dividend was cut to 20 cents per share, down from 40.50 cents in H1 fiscal 25. The Board is now targeting a 30–50% payout policy going forward with a minimum floor of 50 cents per annum, prioritising balance sheet strengthening and financial flexibility over maintaining the previous dividend level.

- **Cost savings programme accelerating under new leadership** — Around 50% of Accelerate programme savings are now expected in fiscal 26, driven by supply chain efficiencies, marketing spend optimisation, and overhead reductions. New CEO Sir Dave Lewis flagged immediate priorities around building competitive category strategies and acting more decisively to enhance competitiveness and broaden the portfolio.
