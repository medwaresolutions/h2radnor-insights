## What Is Consensus?

Consensus expectations represent the average forecasts from sell-side analysts (investment bank research teams) who cover Diageo. These estimates are compiled before results are released and reflect what "the Street" expects the company to deliver. Comparing actuals to consensus tells you whether the company beat, met, or missed expectations — which is what drives the share price reaction on results day.

## H1 FY26: Consensus vs Actual

| Metric | Consensus Estimate | Actual | Beat / Miss |
|--------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Organic net sales growth** | -2.0% | -2.8% | ❌ Miss |
| **Organic operating profit growth** | -3.9% | -2.8% | ✅ Beat |
| **EPS (pre-exceptional)** | 93.1 cents | 95.3 cents | ✅ Beat |
| **Interim dividend** | ~40 cents (maintained) | 20.0 cents | ❌ Shock cut |

**Summary**: A mixed result — the top line (sales) was worse than analysts expected, but the bottom line (profit and EPS) was better than feared thanks to aggressive cost cutting via the Accelerate programme. The real shock was the dividend, which was slashed by more than half versus what most analysts had modelled.

## Key Analyst Reactions

**BofA Securities** (Buy, PT 1,920p): Consensus likely to move lower on sales given revised FY guidance implies organic sales of -1% to -3% in H2, though impact on EBIT and EPS would be modest.

**Jefferies** (Buy, PT 2,000p): Central debate is whether a further profit reset for FY27 could follow once strategic details emerge. Diageo trades at 15.8x CY26E earnings vs staples sector at 19.3x.

**New CEO Sir Dave Lewis** (7 weeks in): Acknowledged the portfolio is strong at the premium end but underrepresented in higher-volume segments. Suggested "surgical" price repositioning by brand, pack size, market, and channel. Full strategic update expected in summer 2026. Cautioned investors not to expect meaningful US plan changes in the next six months.

## Market Reaction

Diageo shares fell **~5–7%** on the day of results, reflecting the combination of:

1. Organic sales miss vs consensus (-2.8% vs -2.0% expected)
2. Downgraded FY26 sales guidance (now -2% to -3% vs prior "flat to slightly down")
3. The dividend cut — a 51% reduction that caught most analysts off guard
4. Uncertainty around the incoming CEO's strategic review (not due until summer 2026)

The EPS beat and maintained free cash flow guidance provided some offset, but were not enough to counteract the negative headlines.
